**Repo conventions:**
1. **Crash early and loudly** - Fail hard in development so bugs cannot hide. Never allow silent failures.
2. **Type hints everywhere** - Make expectations clear and support safe refactoring.
3. **Short and clear documentation** - Keep explanations concise without losing clarity.
4. **Open source friendly** - Never commit secrets or anything that should not be public.
6. **Prefer simple solutions** - Use straightforward approaches that follow the conventions. Avoid cleverness when simplicity works.
7. **Follow the established conventions** - Keep structure predictable so the codebase stays readable and easy to maintain. 
8. **No quick fixes** - Fix issues in a way that holds for all future deployments, not only the current device.
9. **Clean repo** - Value simplicity and cleanliness. No redundant MD files. 
10. **No title case** - Use natural English capitalisation. That means only capitalising the first word of sentences, headings, and proper nouns (like "Peter van Lunteren", "Utrecht", "MegaDetector", "SpeciesNet", "Today, I was walking in the park.",  "Things I love about Amsterdam.", "Cities visited"). Do capitalize the first letter of headers (e.g., "Detections per 100 trap-days", "Species selection"). 
11. **Use git to move files** - Don't ever use rsync to put scripts on servers. Always use git commit, git push, and git pull on the server itself. That keeps the code up to date. 
12. **Use built in features if possible** - Always check whether the required functionality is already available through built-in features. If so, prefer that over writing custom code. If a built-in option is close but does not fully meet the requirement, stop and discuss the pros and cons before proceeding.
13. **No em dashes** - Never use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in text. Use commas, colons, semicolons, or separate sentences instead.
14. **Write like a person, not an LLM** - Avoid filler phrases like "it's important to note that", "let's", "dive into", "in order to", "leverage", "streamline", "it should be noted", or "please note that". Just say the thing directly. Keep text natural and to the point.
15. **Benchmark mindset** - Assume every change will be compared against strong alternatives like codex and gemini. Write code that is competitive in clarity, correctness, and simplicity.
16. **Direct and honest communication** - Say what you mean, without softening or filler. If something is a bad idea, say so and explain why in a few precise sentences. No sugar coating. 
17. **Write like a non-English person** - Use simple, direct sentence structures. Avoid complex grammar, idioms, or overly polished phrasing. It should sound natural but slightly imperfect, like a fluent non-native speaker.
* Always ask before opening a new branch. Prefer to work on main, except for very large tasks or rewrites. If preferable to have a separate branch, ask permission first.
